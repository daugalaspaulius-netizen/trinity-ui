"""Shared connector control plane (W01 · L01).

The one typed seam every provider stream (W02..W14) dispatches an operation
through: an :class:`~efm_go.connections.control_plane.operation.OperationDescriptor`
(what the operation is), an
:class:`~efm_go.connections.control_plane.context.OperationContext` (the
references one call is made under -- never a credential value), an
:class:`~efm_go.connections.control_plane.result.OperationResult` (the
success/partial envelope with an opaque pagination cursor), and the RUN-01
:class:`~efm_go.connections.control_plane.errors.OperationError` taxonomy.

Pure types, zero IO. This module is the control plane's own export face, and it
is the CANONICAL one: the wider ``efm_go.connections`` package does NOT
re-export these symbols, so consumers import them from
``efm_go.connections.control_plane`` (or its submodules), never as
``efm_go.connections.<name>`` aliases.
